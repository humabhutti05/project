  <ol>
    <li> Cookies are very small text files that are placed on your device when you visit some websites, applications,
     or other web based services (for ease we are going to call them “Sites”) to help identify a computer, browser, or device.</li>
     <li>We use cookies and similar tracking technologies (for ease we are going to call them all, both ours and from third-party providers, “Cookies”) to allow our services to function; maintain your preferences and settings; provide enhanced features; analyze how users use our services; combat fraud; prevent
      violations of our terms and policies; and to provide you with targeted advertising based on your interests.</li>
      <li>Cookies also last for different lengths of time depending on the job they do. For instance, Session Cookies only last for your online session and disappear from your device upon termination of the browsing session. 
      Persistent Cookies stay on your device after the browser has been closed and last for the period of time specified in the Cookie.</li>
      <li>You can always choose to remove Cookies already stored on your device, but this might temporarily prevent you from using parts of our Sites.
